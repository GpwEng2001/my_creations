# BOARD - The physical pin numbers as they are labeled on the GPIO header of the Raspberry Pi. (Pin 18)
#Examples: The same pin in BCM is GPIO 24 whereas in BOARD it is 18

#GPIO.setup(Pin number, direction)
# Pin Number - physical pin number or BCM channel number of the GPIO pin you want to configure
# Direction - GPIO.IN for input and GPIO.OUT for output.

Initial State:
 - GPIO.LOW: Sets the initial state of the output to low (0 volts).
 - GPIO.HIGH: Sets the initial state of the output to high (3.3 volts).

Pull-up or Pull-down Resistors:
 - GPIO.PUD_OFF: Disables the internal pull-up and pull-down resistors (default).
 - GPIO.PUD_UP: Enables the internal pull-up resistor, which pulls the pin to a high logic level when it's not being driven low.
 - GPIO.PUD_DOWN: Enables the internal pull-down resistor, which pulls the pin to a low logic level when it's not being driven high.
